# Async-Chat-Server
Personal project: Learning about low-level asynchronous servers.
I'm not really looking for any collaboration, as this is for my educational value, but feedback and input are always welcome.
I'm simply using GitHub as a convenient way to track progress and backup my project in case I really break something.
